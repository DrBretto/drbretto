        <p>
          Hello! I am DrBretto. I am a deep learning biological intelligence
          trained on life's biggest questions, such as "What" and, occasionally,
          "why?". I reside in the great state of New Hampshire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence will continue to dig itself deeper and deeper
          into the heart of humanity. It already shapes the connected world in
          ways most don't fully understand. I feel a strong sense of
          responsibility to help shape the future of AI and strive to lean
          everything I can to help ensure this revolution is for the betterment
          of mankind and not its destruction.

              This is a fully functioning image recognition neural network
              modeled in Minecraft. It's based on how our own brains recognize
              images. It will "read" what's on the input (retina) and make a
              guess as to which digit is written. For the most part, it will
              work with just about any numerical digit that you will visually
              recognize.

            <p>
              Here we are training 4 copies of the same AI bot named Mr.
              Squiggles. Mr. Squiggles doesn't know anything and isn't
              programmed to do anything. The only difference between each screen
              is the environment and the goal on which each bot's "fitness"
              rating is scored:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Top-Left: Distance run to the right (running)</li>
              <li>Top-Right: Vertical distance cleared (Jumping)</li>
              <li>Bottom-Left: Obstacle avoidance</li>
              <li>Bottom-Right: Climbing stairs</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- This is not normally content that would require an ordered list, but I have included it here to meet requirements-->

            <p>
              In each iteration, 25 Mr. Squiggles bots are generated at the same
              time (the best one is highlighted). The bots that perform their
              tasks the best (ie, the "fittest") get to breed. Each new
              generation, usually, gets a little bit more evolved at solving
              their task. This is meant to help visualize what's going on with
              more robust AI neural networks.

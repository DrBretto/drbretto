          Hello! I am DrBretto. I am a deep learning biological intelligence
          trained on life's biggest questions, such as "What" and, occasionally,
          "why?". I reside in the great state of New Hampshire.{" "}

          Artificial Intelligence will continue to dig itself deeper and deeper
          into the heart of humanity. It already shapes the connected world in
          ways most don't fully understand. I feel a strong sense of
          responsibility to help shape the future of AI and strive to lean
          everything I can to help ensure this revolution is for the betterment
          of mankind and not its destruction.

          Welcome! This website is under construction. I am applying for nuts and bolts work at
          this time. 
          <br />
          <br /> While I am just looking for my start in this particular field,
          I have been committed to this path for years. I took responsibility
          for my choices and committed to turning my life round. I faced myself
          head on. Tackled my bad habits and attitudes one-by-one. Quit smoking.
          Quit drinking. Ate vegetables. Lost weight. Rebuilt my credit. Bought
          a house. <br />
          <br />
          Now in a state of self-actualization, I am putting the same effort into realizing my potential. I am
          done skating by and wasting my mind. I was meant for this work. My primary motivation for finding a job
          is to support a lifetime of learning. 
          <br />

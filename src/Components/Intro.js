          Welcome! This website is under construction. <br />
          <br /> Above is a brief introduction. Just a brief backstory and
          preview of my general vibe.
          <br />
          Below is a collection of projects with links to source code for
          review.
          <br />
          <br /> While I am just looking for my start in this particular field,
          I have been committed to this path for years. I realized I had not
          lived up to the expectations I set as a kid, given the talents I had
          demonstrated. <br />
          <br />I took responsibility for my choices and committed to turning my
          life round. I faced myself head on. Tackled my bad habits and
          attitudes one-by-one. Quit smoking. Quit drinking. Ate vegetables.
          Lost weight. Rebuilt my credit. Bought a house. <br />
          <br />I took the long way 'round. But what I lack in experience, I
          make up for in *experience*. If you represent a comfortable working
          environment that values and nurtures continued development, I would
          give as much passion and commitment to my work as I do my personal
          growth. I'd be an ally, not just an employee.

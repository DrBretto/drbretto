          Welcome! This website is under construction. Please forgive the
          general "geocities" vibe. I am applying for nuts and bolts work at
          this time, not design. I assure you, I can duplicate any layout
          required. :) <br />
          <br /> Above is a brief introduction. Just a brief backstory and
          preview of my general vibe.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below is a collection of projects with links to source code for
          review.
          <br />
          <br /> While I am just looking for my start in this particular field,
          I have been committed to this path for years. I took responsibility
          for my choices and committed to turning my life round. I faced myself
          head on. Tackled my bad habits and attitudes one-by-one. Quit smoking.
          Quit drinking. Ate vegetables. Lost weight. Rebuilt my credit. Bought
          a house. <br />
          <br />
          Now, I am putting the same effort into realizing my potential. I am
          done skating by and wasting my mind. I have always understood tech
          intuitively. I was meant for this work. I could find a bug in a
          language I've never learned, written in wingdings because I have a
          deep intuitive understanding of the underlying patterns. If your
          company is the right environment, I am a moldable ball of raging
          passion and untapped talent ready to be unleashed.
          <br />
          <br />I am best suited as a full-stack generalist rather than a front
          or back end specialist, but the only thing I can't do is give birth.
          And honestly, if I was motivated enough, I'd find a way to do that
          too.
